// List and briefly describe the types of algorithmic time complexity.
// Be as clear and complete as necessary to demonstrate your mastery.
// Write your explanation below as a comment
/*
1- 1(n^0) ---- constant have only variable without loop or iterate 
2-O (n^1) --- linear have one loop 
3- log (n) --- can divide the elements into tow groups or more 
4- n*n -- O(n^2)quardratic  -----  loop inside loop
