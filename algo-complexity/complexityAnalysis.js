// List and briefly describe the types of algorithmic time complexity.
// Be as clear and complete as necessary to demonstrate your mastery.
// Write your explanation below as a comment
/*
1- constant O(1) because we execute constant number of operation (constant time approach) 
2-O (n) --- linear execution time increase proportionally to the input size
3- log (n) --- cO(log n) --- execution time increase but at decreasing rate 
4- O(n^2)quardratic  -----  execution time increase at an increasing rate
